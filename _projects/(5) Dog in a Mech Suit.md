# Dog in a Mech Suit
<br>
_Dog in a Mech Suit_ (working title) is a work-in-progress game I've been solo developing for several years:<br> It's an action-packed roguelike where you control one of 12 unique dogs, each with their own special ability, battling through a procedurally generated Pastel City with endless equipment combinations and a clean, polished art style.
