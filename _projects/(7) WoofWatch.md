<br>
[_WoofWatch_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3458330/WoofWatch/) is a work-in-progress game I've been solo developing for several years:<br> It's an action-packed roguelike where you play as one of 12 unique mech-suited-dogs, each with their own special ability, battling through a procedurally generated Pastel City with endless equipment combinations and a clean, polished art style.<br>Capsule illustration by [Molly Stanard](https://www.mollystanard.com/).
